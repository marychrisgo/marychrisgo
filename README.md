## Hello! 👋 😄

Hi, I'm MC... an Applied Physics major. I’m currently a Geospatial Intern at Thinking Machines Data Science. :heart: 🔭 I am very interested with projects that deal with image processing and computer vision. :science: 

### 🌱 What’s your ✨ Big 5 Personality Type? ✨

**Openness**

I like exploring and experiencing new things. I think I do have a wide spectrum of interests. Talk to me about anything, I'm pretty sure I'll be interested. 

**Conscientousness**

Checklists are my best friend. I always end my day writing a to-do list for tomorrow. During the lockdown period, I still make a checklist. It sounds boring, but I'm proud of developing that habit. I set deadlines earlier than the actual deadlines as well. With that, I get to prepare from unforeseen events. 

**Extraversion**

Definitely an extrovert! Quarantine drained my social energy. Glad to have social messaging apps to connect to old friends and of course, meeting new people through TM internship. Social interaction comes naturally to me. 

**Agreeableness**

I am friendly and cooperative. But I guess I am not *that* affectionate. Not sure if because I'm tired of life or I'm just a *halaman* in general.

**Neuroticism**

I'm pretty emotionally stable. I used to be unstable but a good supporting system and journaling every day helped me. I guess I can say there's a redemption arc, *hahaha*.

For context, I took the exam from [Truity](https://www.truity.com/test/big-five-personality-test).

My MBTI personality type is [ENTJ](https://www.16personalities.com/entj-personality) (Think of Erwin from Attack On Titan). For context, I took the exam from the most accurate site (just my two cents) [Jupiter](https://jupiter-34.appspot.com/).
