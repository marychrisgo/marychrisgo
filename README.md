## Hello! ðŸ‘‹ ðŸ˜„

Hi, I'm MC... an Applied Physics graduate. I am very interested with projects that deal with image processing and computer vision. :microscope: Currently, I'm taking a triple-degree master's program under Erasmus Mundus Joint Masters Degrees (EMJMDs).  

### ðŸŒ± Whatâ€™s your âœ¨ MBTI âœ¨ ?

My MBTI personality type is [ENTJ](https://www.16personalities.com/entj-personality) (Think of Erwin from Attack On Titan). For context, I took the exam from the most accurate site (just my two cents) [Jupiter](https://jupiter-34.appspot.com/).
