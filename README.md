## Hello! 👋 😄

Hi, I'm MC... an Applied Physics major. I’m currently a Geospatial Intern at Thinking Machines Data Science. :heart: 🔭 I am very interested with projects that deal with image processing and computer vision. :microscope:

### 🌱 What’s your ✨ MBTI ✨ ?

My MBTI personality type is [ENTJ](https://www.16personalities.com/entj-personality) (Think of Erwin from Attack On Titan). For context, I took the exam from the most accurate site (just my two cents) [Jupiter](https://jupiter-34.appspot.com/). 


### ⚡ What do you do for fun?

* playing musical instruments
* study Spanish
* eating BFF McDo fries with bbq sauce alone
* watching F1 
* board games (Risk, Catan, etc.)
* diving with siblings
* playing FPS games 
* reading self-help books
* inom (I have asian flush, don't panic.)
* YouTube-ing ([exurb1a](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCimiUgDLbi6P17BdaCZpVbg) is my favorite channel)
* taking portraits of other people

PS. Play with me if you want to do some heavy-lifting (sorry huhu)!!!
